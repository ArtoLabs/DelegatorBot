        The settings file for the bot.

        BE SURE TO ADJUST THE VALUES OF THIS FILE AFTER INSTALLATION 
        OR YOU WILL RECIEVE ERRORS.

        To run more than one bot, simply copy this file and rename it
        with the name of the bot e.g. mybotname.py. Adjust all the values
        for the new bot and make sure that the name of the bot, the delegation
        link, database table names, and steemit posting and active keys
        are unique to each bot. To run the bot simply type "runbot", plus
        the command, plus the name of the bot e.g. 

        runbot steemboost mybotname
